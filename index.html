    <h1>• Irdyacraft •</h1>
    <p>Irdyacraft will be personal project to recreate the entire world of "<a href="https://www.wesnoth.org">The Battle for Wesnoth</a>" in "<a href=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us>Minecraft</a>". The project will not build absolutely everything, but it plans to build all notable locations, such as Weldyn, Elensefar and Glamdrol. It will probably never be finished.</p>
