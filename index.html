    <h1>• Irdyacraft •</h1>
    <p>Irdyacraft will be personal project to recreate the entire world of "The Battle for Wesnoth" in Minecraft. The project will not build absolutely everything, but it plans to build all notable locations, such as Weldyn, Elensefar and Glamdrol. It will probably never be finished.</p>
